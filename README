This is an incomplete app, provided to demonstrate a few new concepts:

1. HAML instead of HTML and ERb
2. How to turn off layouts
3. An application design that is not great yet not too bad
4. How to load HTML via Ajax

Things you can try to do next:

1. Use Ajax for the "Add to Cart" button instead of a normal form submission
2. Think about a better overall design in terms of modeling or controller architecture
3. Maybe there's a better way to simplify the use of partials than is used now
